# Event-Tracker
A scheduling web app consisting of Material Ui components and a virtual backend. Full functionality occurs after creating the virtual backend

To run the Virtual back end you'll need to install json-server via npm or yarn then add the following line of code to your "scripts" in any package.json

"server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000 "

Run "npm server" or "yarn server". The app should work swimmingly!
